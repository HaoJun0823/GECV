# GECV
GECV is a collection of tools for translating the PC version of GOD EATER.

These tools are only used for batch processing of files with a fixed structure. It does not mean that these tools have 100% reliable MOD and editing functions. These tools are still not fully verified.„ÄÅ
If you want to do more, you will still need a binary editor to modify game data, and we will not continue to update/improve these tools in the future as we have completed the Chinese translation.
Console versions such as PSP/PSV/PS4 are not supported by us. What we currently have is only applicable to the PC version.

A data structure known to us (currently only in Chinese) is included in the file.
