# GECV
GECV is a collection of tools for translating the PC version of GOD EATER.

These tools are only used for batch processing of files with a fixed structure. It does not mean that these tools have 100% reliable MOD and editing functions. These tools are still not fully verified.„ÄÅ
If you want to do more, you will still need a binary editor to modify game data, and we will not continue to update/improve these tools in the future as we have completed the Chinese translation.
Console versions such as PSP/PSV/PS4 are not supported by us. What we currently have is only applicable to the PC version.

A data structure known to us (currently only in Chinese) is included in the file.

Due to the end of the project and the sensitivity relative to the game, I will not provide help with the source code, it will only be open. If you have any questions, please report here.

# This is the PC version of the toolkit, don't expect too much from other platforms.
# Since we have completed what we need, this project is discontinued.
